# Machine Learning
Basic implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch to understand them better.

## Implemented so far:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression (using matrix solution)
3. Gradient Descent - batch and stochastic
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Decision Trees
7. K-Means Clustering
8. Neural Network ( with fixed hidden layer + batch gradient descent)
